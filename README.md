<!-- # Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### React, Node.js, MySQL 연동해보기
서버단은 node, 프론트는 reqact, DB는 MySQL을 사용하는 연습하기  
목표는 기본적인 CRUD를 동작할 수 있도록 하는 것  
프론트의 꾸밈에는 크게 신경쓰지 않고 진행할 예정

<h4>현재 상황</h4>
createPost페이지에서 사용자로부터 제목, 내용, 장소를 입력받으면 DB에 제목, 내용과 장소의 X.Y좌표를 저장.  
DetailPost페이지에서 해당 내용을 전부 불러와 data에 저장.  
data에 잘 저장된 것을 확인했으나, staticMapContainer의 생성 전(null값일 때)에 변수를 참조하려 해서 Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'defaultView')에러 발생.
